A bottom-up deterministic parser with lookahead of 1 (so far).

node-modules isn't committed, of course, so 'npm install' to get things going.

Right now, the only way to see it in action is to run 'npm test'. 

Next steps include: 
  Integrating with D3 to create a nice visualization of parse trees that lets you toggle true/false values
  New visitor classes that allow contextual parsing (i.e., XML)
